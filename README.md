Drowsiness-Detection:
Introduction:-
Drowsiness-Detection is a machine learning project designed to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using computer vision techniques. This project aims to enhance road safety by alerting drivers when signs of drowsiness are detected.

Features:
Real-time video processing
Eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation for blink detection
Drowsiness detection based on blink frequency and duration
Alerts when drowsiness is detected
Installation:
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
git clone https://github.com/Avadhesh2/Drowsiness-Detection.git
cd Drowsiness-Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the main script to start the drowsiness detection system.
python main.py

How It Works
Face Detection: The system uses a pre-trained model to detect faces in the video stream.
Eye Detection: It then locates the eyes within the detected face region.
EAR Calculation: The Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) is calculated to determine the state of the eyes (open, partially open, or closed).
Drowsiness Detection: If the eyes remain closed for a certain duration, the system triggers an alert indicating potential drowsiness.
